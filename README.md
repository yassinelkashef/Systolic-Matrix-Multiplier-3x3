# Systolic Matrix Multiplier 3x3
#### The Systolic Matrix Multiplier (3x3) is a hardware implementation designed to efficiently perform matrix multiplication using a systolic array architecture.
#### Processing Elements (PEs): The heart of the design, PEs handle the multiplication, addition, and shifting operations. Each PE operates synchronously with the system clock, providing a structured and synchronized approach to computation.
#### Here is the Arcitecture of the design
